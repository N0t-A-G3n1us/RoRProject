# Ruby on Rails Tutorial sample application

This is the sample application for
[*Ruby on Rails Tutorial:
Learn Web Development with Rails*](http://www.railstutorial.org/)
by [Michael Hartl](http://www.michaelhartl.com/).

## License

All source code in the [Ruby on Rails Tutorial](http://railstutorial.org/)

[LICENSE.md](LICENSE.md) for details.

## Getting started

To get started with the app, clone the repo and then install the needed gems:

```
$ bundle install --without production
```

Next, migrate the database:

```
$ rails db:migrate
```

Finally, run the test suite to verify that everything is working correctly:

```
$ rails test
```

If the test suite passes, you'll be ready to run the app in a local server:

```
$ rails server
```

For more information, see the
[*Ruby on Rails Tutorial* book](http://www.railstutorial.org/book).

This README would normally document whatever steps are necessary to get the
application up and running.

Things you may want to cover:

* Ruby version

* System dependencies

* Configuration

* Database creation

* Database initialization

* How to run the test suite

* Services (job queues, cache servers, search engines, etc.)

* Deployment instructions

# WEBSOCKET SET UP WITH REDIS 

Download and install

```
$ wget http://download.redis.io/redis-stable.tar.gz
$ tar xvzf redis-stable.tar.gz
$ cd redis-stable
$ make
```
It is a good idea to copy both the Redis server and the command line interface in proper places, either manually using the following commands:

```
$ sudo cp src/redis-server /usr/local/bin/
$ sudo cp src/redis-cli /usr/local/bin/

```
Or just using 

```

$ sudo make install.

```

In the following documentation we assume that /usr/local/bin is in your PATH environment variable so that you can execute both the binaries without specifying the full path.

Run the redis server on another shell 

```
$ redis-server
```
